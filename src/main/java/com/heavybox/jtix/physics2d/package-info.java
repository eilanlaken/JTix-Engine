/**
 * This package contains the classes and interfaces for the 2D physics engine
 * of the JTix game engine. The physics engine handles all aspects of
 * physical simulations, including collision detection, resolution, and
 * physics calculations such as forces, velocities, and accelerations.
 *
 * <p>
 * The main components include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Body - Represents a physical body in the physics simulation.</li>
 *   <li>BodyCollider (abstract) - Abstract base class for different types of colliders attached to bodies.</li>
 *   <li>BodyColliderCircle - Collider for circular shapes.</li>
 *   <li>BodyColliderPolygon - Collider for polygonal shapes.</li>
 *   <li>BodyColliderRectangle - Collider for rectangular shapes.</li>
 *   <li>Collision - A class that contains code for collision detection.</li>
 *   <li>CollisionManifold - Contains information about a collision, such as contact points and penetration depth.</li>
 *   <li>CollisionSolver - Solves collisions by calculating and applying necessary responses.</li>
 *   <li>Constraint (abstract) - Abstract base class for constraints applied to bodies.</li>
 *   <li>ConstraintDistance - Constraint that maintains a fixed distance between two bodies.</li>
 *   <li>ConstraintPin - Constraint that fixes a body to a specific point in space.</li>
 *   <li>ForceField (abstract) - Represents a field that calculates a force to be applied on a body based on a function.</li>
 *   <li>Physics2DException - Custom exception for handling errors specific to the physics engine. When something goes wrong in the physics engine, Physics2DException will be thrown.</li>
 *   <li>Physics2DUtils - Utility class providing common physics-related calculations and methods.</li>
 *   <li>RayCasting - Provides methods for performing ray casting operations.</li>
 *   <li>RayCastingCallback (interface) - Callback interface for handling ray casting results.</li>
 *   <li>RayCastingIntersection - Represents an intersection point found during ray casting.</li>
 *   <li>RayCastingRay - Represents a ray used in ray casting operations.</li>
 *   <li>World - The core of the physics engine, managing all physics objects and simulations.</li>
 *   <li>WorldRenderer - Handles the rendering of the physics world for debugging and visualization purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>

 * <h2>How the Physics Engine Works</h2>
 * <p>
 * The physics engine operates by simulating the physical interactions between
 * bodies within the game world. The process involves several key steps:
 *   <ol>
 *
 *   </ol>
 * This cycle repeats at a fixed timestep to create a smooth and realistic simulation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing easy integration
 * with the rest of the JTix engine and providing a robust foundation for game physics.
